JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a Java technology that helps software developers serve
dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. Released
in 1999 as Sun's answer to ASP and PHP,[citation needed] JSP was designed to address
the perception that the Java programming environment didn't provide developers with
enough support for the Web. To deploy and run, a compatible web server with servlet
container is required. The Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications
from Sun Microsystems and the JCP (Java Community Process) must both be met by the
container.
